        <article><h3>The Challenge in my 9-week internship as graphic designer</h3>
        <p>July 13, 2025</p>
            <p>During my 9-week internship, I had challenges with using Photoshop and Illustrator because I wasn't used to this program too much. 
             I also struggled with time management when I had too many ideas but not enough time.</p>
            <p>To solve this, I practiced a lot, watched tutorials, and asked for help from PP.
             I learned to organize my work, simplify ideas, and manage my time better. Even when I didn't have a main task, I learned by helping and observing others.
             These experiences helped me improve both my skills.</p>
